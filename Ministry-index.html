      <p>ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS, a MOUNTAIN of focus, uniquely positioned, founded by GOD, dominating biblical chapters and prophecies. It abide for ever. Isaiah 14:32, Psalm 125:1.

        This is the ministry GOD has in HIS infinite Wisdom, Mercy and Power committed into our hands, it is the Ministry of: ‘MOUNTAIN OF ZION’ which shall be for all nations. That is: “ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS”. Isaiah 2:1-2 & Micah 4:1-2.
        
        It is a full scale APOSTOLIC ministry as of the days of CHRIST JESUS and HIS Apostles. A no nonsense Ministry, destroying the works of the Devil and his agents. Holding firmly to the WORD of GOD with no Addition, Subtraction or Contradiction. JESUS only is our Message, HE is our Model, Standard, Author and Finisher of our faith. In HIM only we live and have our being.
        
        Then I looked, and behold, I saw the LAMB standing on the ZION MOUNTAIN as was truly revealed to Apostle John the beloved- Revelation 14:1a,b.
        
        Feel free to join us in any of our programmes and at any of our fellowship centres. And as you do so, you shall surely have an encounter with the HUSBAND of the church HIMSELF (CHRIST JESUS OUR SAVIOUR AND LORD). Amen.
        
        CHRIST JESUS our all, ZION CITY our goal.</p>

          <h2>ABOUT US - <br><br>ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS </h2>
          <p>

            is as audibly announced and hand written by GOD. Started with prayer fellowship in our sitting room with my family and metamorphosed into Males Prayer Vigil on the 12th of February 2014 kick staring the commencement of the Ministry. The Ministry launched out in 10/10/2014 with an Interdenominational Vigil Programme tagged: "Our Lord's Night" held at Murphy Event Hall, Jakande Estate, Oke-Afa, Isolo, Lagos. The Hall was  filled to capacity and dominated by the presence of God. Among the guest ministers includes: with Pastor Kunle Ajayi of Redeemed Christian Church of God, Evangelist Tope Alabi and her band, Evangelist Biola Lawal Olubiyi and some of my sons in the Lord. It also featured Kenny Black.
            
            ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS is a Unique Ministry, solely Headed and Controlled by CHRIST JESUS in HIS WISDOM through the HOLY-SPIRIT. A Ministry Established on Apostolic Throne of Prophetic Lineage with Pentecostal Crown of Anointing-Oil, with Infinite Staff of Authority and Power, set on Fire on world End-Time Evangelism and Crusade Mission with the total backing of the SOVEREIGN TRIUNE GOD of the Prophets and the Apostles. Commissioned for: Salvation, Deliverance, Illumination, Revelation, Guidance, Healing, Miracles, Signs and Wonders for the over-all comfort, prosperity and benefit of men, and for the overall purpose of populating the Kingdom of CHRIST to the Praise and Glory of GOD ALMIGHTY.
            
            At ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS, we centre everything on CHRIST JESUS for HE is: our LORD, our SAVIOUR, our MAKER, our LEADER and our KING- the ESTABLISHER, OWNER and SUSTAINER of Zion Mountain Ministry for all Nations. HE is Our ALPHA and OMEGA, the only begotten SON of the LIVING GOD in operation in us and in the last days through the HOLY-SPIRIT of GOD, having UNLIMITED NAME, UNLIMITED POWER and UNLIMITED RESOURCES. The TRUE GOD that CREATE, can CREATE and can RECREATE.
            
            Here at Zion Mountain Ministry for all Nations, we believe that after Salvation and Sanctification of soul, the fruit of the SPIRIT is the primary (basic) for a successful christian living upon which fire falls, foundation for which the gifts of the SPIRIT lay, without undermining key importance of water baptism by immersion.
            
            At ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS, we give equal opportunity for the five fold ministry (Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic, Pastoral and Teaching ministry) to thrive, as well as GOD given biblical gifts in the lives of individual member of the church. Not as to compete but to complement each other for the edification of the church and maturity of the GOD’S children.
            
            Without any shadow of doubt, we strongly believe and stand firmly only on the WORD of GOD as contained in the Holy-Scriptures (Bible) with no addition, subtraction or contradiction. We reference and pray to/through no other God, not even man, an angel, a spirit or any object, but directly to ALMIGHTY SOVEREIGN GOD of Israel through CHRIST JESUS HIS SON (our LORD), effectual in us through HOLYSPIRIT.
            
            We engage/imbibe in our People a culture of: Gospel base Faith, Prayer-Possibilities, Unconditional-Praise, True-Love, Spirit Controlled Life Style, Strategic-Planning, Excellence, Holistic-Well-being, Team-Work, Self-Empowerment, Gospel Propagation, and exercising their Authority and Power in CHRIST JESUS.
            
            Our ultimate goal in ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS is to make Heaven and lead nations into the Kingdom of GOD and of HIS CHRIST, to show forth and celebrate the GLORY, GREATNESS and GOODNESS of CHRIST JESUS our LORD our GOD.

          <p>

            HAS PROCLAIMED BY THE WORD OF GOD, “ZION MOUNTAIN” is the new name/another name for MOUNT ZION (MOUNTAIN OF ZION) as prophesied by the Holy Prophet- Isaiah 62:1-2, and as audibly revealed to GOD’S servant: Pastor Michael Babajide Oresegun in 1997, as a confirmation of HIS words, fulfilment of HIS prophecy, appointment and commencement of an end-time ministerial assignment (harvest of souls), destroying every form of resistance against the plans and programmes of the LIVING GOD of Israel for our GOD is a MOUNTAIN, a ROCK, and a CONSUMING FIRE- Hebrew 12:22-24.
            
            *AS PROPHESIED BY Prophet ISAIAH AND SECONDED BY PROPHET MICAH, “it shall come to pass in the latter days (end time) that the MOUNTAIN (ZION MOUNTAIN) of the LORD’S HOUSE shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it. Many people shall come and say, let us go to the MOUNTAIN of the LORD house of Jacob, and HE shall teach us HIS way and we shall work in HIS path, saying: ‘Come, and let us go up to the MOUNTAIN of the LORD, to the house of the GOD of Jacob; HE shall teach us HIS ways, and we shall walk in HIS paths.’ For out of ZION shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem". 
            
            *So, this is THE LATTER MOUNTAIN OF THE LORD’S HOUSE (ZION MOUNTAIN) ESTABLISHED ON THE TOP OF MOUNTAINS, EXALTED ABOVE ALL HILLS FOR THE ENDTIME INFLOW OF ALL NATIONS. So it is, so shall the 'Ministry' be known, called and remain: ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS. THE “MOUNTAIN” IS CHRIST JESUS/HEAD CHURCH OF THE LIVING SON OF GOD THAT CAME FROM ZION (HEAVENLY JERUSALEM CITY OF the LIVING GOD), SET ABOVE ALL NATIONS (the Heavens and the Universe), either: GOVERNMENTS, PRINCIPALITIES, POWERS, RULERS OF DARKNESS OF THE WORLD AND SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS IN HIGH PLACES. Even above Time, Season, PRINCIPLE, PROTOCOL, THOUGHT, WORD, ACTION, HANDWRITING and ORDINANCE against the WILL of GOD ALMIGHTY. This is HE that IS, HE that WAS, and HE that IS TO COME. THE ALPHA and OMEGA, LIVING and EVERLASTING KEY OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID called YHWH a MYSTERY. Philipian 2:9-11.
            
            *THE VERY GATE OF HEAVEN (ZION MOUNTAIN), where the LAMB of GOD is seen and life is preserved. An arena for mortal man to see CHRIST JESUS his MAKER the WORD of GOD face-to-face and communicate with the HOLYSPIRIT unhindered. A CITY above all problems, diseases, challenges and life obstacles. A MOUNTAIN of prayer, the abode of numerous angels ministering to the saints of GOD, ascending (taking up prayers) and descending (bringing down blessings). The Spiritual platform Where life Journey of uncertainty becomes an entrance into Abraham’s blessings. Place where curse and old nature gives way for new name and new covenant. The Citadel of HIS MAJESTY, Centre of Excellence, Sure Venue for Divine Intervention coursing world wide Jubilation. Where sinners are forgiven their sins and punishment disappear for pardon and prosperity. The point in life where an outcast from Laban’s house becomes a father of many nations, and prosperously full of peace. The point of realisation that all tithes (10%) of all our income belong to GOD and must be taken to HIS House and given to HIM to effect new in-flow of more and better out-pour of rain of abundant generational miraculous blessings. Juncture realm where GOD devotes HIS time and all HIS resources to satisfy the yearning and aspirations of HIS people. The Land of succour where absolutely noting shall be impossible through the working effect of HOLYSPIRIT in the name of CHRIST JESUS to the Glory of the GOD of the Lineage of Judah, the Enthroned Temple GOD of Solomon, Conquering Backbone of David, the LIVING Exodus GOD of Moses WHO alone is I AM that I AM, the Faithful Memorial GOD of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the covenant keeping GOD of Israel. Genesis 35:11-22.
            
            *THE ANCIENT LIVING STONE
            Prophet Daniel in his prophecies on last days events, told us of about the end time agenda of our GOD on Mount Zion (ZION MOUNTAIN), that it shall be an Assignment (MINISTRY) for World Evangelism (FOR ALL NATIONS). According to Daniel 2:35-45, “this is the very STONE that struck the image seen (dreamt about) by Nebuchadnezzar then king of Babylon of which this STONE later became a GREAT MOUNTAIN (ZION MOUNTAIN) and filled the whole earth. As also prophesied by Daniel that: “The dream is certain and the interpretation is sure (shall come to pass at the latter days/end-time”. Now is the time, the end-time is here, the anti-christ at work and event unfolding. Revelation 12, 13, 14; Matthew 24; “John 12:32″.
            
            *THE MARVELLOUS CITY where the perfection of beauty GOD has shined- Psalm 50:2. An invisible ‘MOUNTAIN’ that cannot be touched, but spiritually conspicuous to behold, approached and touched by the citizens. HE is the WAY, the TRUTH and the LIFE, the WISDOM and the POWER behind creation, the very LIGHT of GOD that darkness from ages past, present and future cannot and can never comprehend. Very friendly but fearfully powerful, offering a better/new testament (GRACE) than the other- mountain/mount sinai (LAW). An UNSHAKEABLE MOUNTAIN where GOD is well loved, referenced and served in holiness and godly fear. Where GOD operate as a CONSUMING FIRE. Hebrews 12:18-29.
            
            *THE GLORY OF THE NATION OF ISRAEL, the very LIGHT of the whole world that will bring illumination and revelation to the Gentiles, the principal CITY set on a hill that cannot be hidden- ZION MOUNTAIN, the MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS, PICK above all churches, of two feet and arms stretched out, ONE for the Salvation of the Jewish Nation, and the Other for the Salvation of the Gentiles Nations, for the Orthodox-Traditional and Fire-Pentecostal/Evangelical-Apostolic . Matthew 5:14 and Luke 2:32.
            
            *THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. 
            ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS, a SOLUTION ground where GOD regularly lavish showers of Blessings and Miracles on HIS people unrestrained. The spiritual theatre where GOD’S SPIRITO-SOGICAL OPERATIONS is beyond scientific comprehension.
            
            *THIS IS THAT ZION MOUNTAIN CHOSEN BY GOD HIMSELF for the Deliverance, Holiness and Prosperity of HIS people. A sure place for salvation, healing, miracles, signs and wonders. Obadiah 1:17.
            
            *CHRIST exalted Church (ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS) that is established on the top of other Mountains, and exalted above Hills. The end time church of CHRIST, where lies the hope of all nations, so they will troop into CHRIST JESUS: The SAVIOUR of the world amounting to the Joy of the whole earth. Isaiah 2:1-3, John 12:32, Psalm 48:2, Matthew 2:10 & 4:23-25.
            
            *A MOUNTAIN (ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS) where GOD’S words and directives must be absolutely obeyed. A MOUNTAIN of PURE-ANOINTING, of PRAISE-ADORATION, and of PRAYER-ANWSWERED. A Perfect Path to Peace, Purity, Protection, Provision, Prosperity and Preternatural Pentecostal Power against any form of Pandemonium and Predicament. Deuteronomy 28, Psalm 125, John 14:12-16.
            
            *ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS, a MOUNTAIN of focus, uniquely positioned, founded by GOD, dominating biblical chapters and prophecies. It abide for ever. Isaiah 14:32, Psalm 125:1.
            
            This is the ministry GOD has in HIS infinite Wisdom, Mercy and Power committed into our hands, it is the Ministry of: ‘MOUNTAIN OF ZION’ which shall be for all nations. That is: “ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS”. Isaiah 2:1-2 & Micah 4:1-2.
            
            *It is a full scale APOSTOLIC ministry as of the days of CHRIST JESUS and HIS Apostles. A no nonsense Ministry, destroying the works of the Devil and his agents. Holding firmly to the WORD of GOD with no Addition, Subtraction or Contradiction. JESUS only is our Message, HE is our Model, Standard, Author and Finisher of our faith. In HIM only we live and have our being.
            
            *Then I looked, and behold, I saw the LAMB standing on the ZION MOUNTAIN as was truly revealed to Apostle John the beloved- Revelation 14:1a,b.

        <h2>OUR DOCTRINE</h2>
        <p>
          Doing Good for the Sake of the Gospel You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine – Titus 2:1.
          
          Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers – 1 Timothy 4:16.
          
          For the time will come when people will not listen to sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear - 2 Timothy 4:3.
          
          You must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that you can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it - Titus 1:9.
          
          I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus (be firmly alert) so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer - 1 Timothy 1:3.
          
          Warn the unbelievers, the drunkards, sexually immoral, those practising homosexuality, slave traders and liars and perjurers, sinners— whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine - 1 Timothy 1:10.
          
          JESUS said: “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it". “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognise them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them".
          “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’ 
          “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”
          When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law – Matt. 7:13-28.
          
          So now I implore you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them” (Romans 16:17).
          
          ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS THE END TIME TEACHER OF SOUND DOCTRINE ACCORDING TO PROPHECY:
          The vision that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. That it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the LORD’S house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it. Many people shall come and say, “Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the GOD of Jacob; He shall teach us his ways, and we shall walk in his paths.” For out of ZION shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem- Isaiah 2:1 -3, Acts 2:42; I Timothy 4:16; Titus 1:9.
          
          THE WORD of GOD teaches and we believe:
          1. The Holy Bible, consisting of 39 books of the Old Testament and 27 books of the New Testament, is the inspired Word of God. We take the Bible as final authority in all matters concerning Christian conduct and works. 2 Timothy 3:16,17; Proverbs 30:5,6; Revelation 22:18,19.
          
          2. The Godhead consists of three separate, distinct, and recognizable personalities and qualities, perfectly united in one. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are different Persons in the Godhead, not merely three names for one Person. Mathew 3:16, 17; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Mathew 28:19,20.
          
          3. The virgin birth of Jesus, the only begotten Son of God. The crucifixion, death, burial and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ. Isaiah 7:14; Mathew 1:18-25; Romans 1:4; 1 Corinthians 15:3,4.
          
          4. The total depravity sinfulness and guilt of all men since the Fall, rendering them subject to God’s wrath and condemnation. Psalm 51:5; Job 14:4; Romans 3:23; 5:12-17; Mark 7:21-23; Ephesians 2:1.
          
          5. That repentance is a complete turning away from all sins and its deceitful pleasures and that it is required from every sinner before he can truly and effectively believe in Jesus with saving faith. Proverbs 28:13; Isaiah 55:7; Ezekiel 18:21-23; Mark 1:15; Luke 24:46,47; Acts 2:38; 3:19,21; 2 Corinthians 7:10; Hebrews 6:1-3.
          
          6. That restitution is making amends for wrongs done against our fellow men, restoring stolen things to the rightful owners, paying debts, giving back where one has defrauded, making confessions to the offended and apologizing to those slandered so as to have a conscience void of offence towards God and man. Genesis 20:1-8; 14-18; Exodus 22:1-7; Leviticus 6:1-17; Numbers 5:6-8; 2 Samuel 12:1-6; Proverbs 6:31; Ezekiel 33:14-16; Mathew 23:24; Luke 19:8,9; Acts 23:1-5; 24:16; James 4:17; 5:6.
          
          7. That justification (or Regeneration) is the act of God’s grace whereby one receives forgiveness and remission of sins and is counted righteous before God, through faith in the atoning blood of Jesus, standing before God as though he had never sinned. Psalms 32:1,2; Isaiah 1:18; Micah 7:19; John 3:3-8;; Acts 13:38,39; Romans 3:24-30; 4:6-16; 5:1,2; 2 Corinthians 5:17-21; Galatians 2:16; Ephesians 2:8,9; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:23.
          
          8. That Water Baptism is essential to our obedience after reconciliation with God. Water Baptism is one immersion (not three) “In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” as Jesus commanded. Mathew 28:19; 3:13-17; Mark 16:15; Acts 2:38,39; 19:1-6; Romans 6:4,5.
          
          9. That the Lord’s Supper was constituted by Jesus Christ so that all believers (all members of the family of God) might partake thereof regularly, to “shew the Lord’s death till He come”. The emblems used are “unleavened bread” and the juice of “fruit of the vine”. Anyone who eats and drinks unworthily brings “damnation”, punishment and chastisement upon himself. Mathew 26:26-29; Luke 22:17-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-30.
          
          10. That Entire Sanctification is a definite act of God’s grace, subsequent to the New Birth, by which the believer’s heart is purified and made holy. It cannot be attained progressively by works, struggle or suppression, but is obtained by faith in the sanctifying blood of Jesus Christ. Holiness of life and purity of heart are central to Christian living. Luke 1:74,,75; John 17:15-17; 1 Thessalonians 4:3,7,8; 5:22-24; Ephesians 5:25-27; Hebrews 2:11; 10:10,14; 13:11,12; Titus 2:11-14; 1 John 1:7; Hebrews 12:14, 1 Peter 1:14-16.
          
          11. That the Baptism in the Holy Ghost is the enduement of power from on High upon the sanctified believer. It is “the promise of the Father” and when one receives this “gift of the Holy Ghost”, it is accompanied by the initial evidence of speaking a language unlearned previously, referred to as speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance. Mathew 3:11; Acts 1:88; Luke 3:16; 24:49; John 1:30-33; 7:37-39; 14:16,17,26; 16:12-15; Acts 1:5-8; Mark 16:17; Acts 2:1-18; 10:44-46; 19:1-6.
          We do not teach or instruct people how to speak in tongues; the Holy Spirit gives utterance. We also stress the necessity of Purity before Power. The Gifts of the Spirit are for today. 1 Corinthians 12:1-31; 14:1-40.
          
          12. That Priesthood of all Believers is the individual disciple/believer have direct prayer access to the throne of grace and to leading of the Holy-Spirit in line with the Holy Bible. That Prayer is not to be made in/through the name of anybody/thing but directly to God by the name of Christ Jesus His Son. 1peter 2:9, 1ct 12, Joel 2:28, Matthew 7:7-8, John 14:11-15.
          
          13. That constant Love and United Fellowship of body of Christ is a must obey command for all true believers of Christ who desire to make Heaven. So, it is expected of true believers of CHRIST to constantly fellowship together in love and unity as done by Christ and His Apostles (disciples). Acts 2, Hebrews 10:25, ￼John 17:21, Psalm 133, Romans 16:17-18 
          
          14. That Deliverance from the curse of the law, curses, evil covenant, sickness and diseases are to be enjoyed by believers of Christ as provided for all people through the sacrificial ministry of Christ Jesus of Jesus . Exodus 15:26; Deuteronomy 7:15; Psalms 103:1-5; Proverbs 4:20-22; Isaiah 8:16,17; 1 Peter 2:24; Mark 16:15-18; Luke 13:16; John 14:12-14; 10:10; Acts 10:38; James 5:14-16; 1 John 3:8; 3 John 2; Galatians 3:13,14.
          
          15. That Personal Evangelism is a God-given and God-ordained ministry for every believer. Jesus commanded and God requires every believer to be a compassionate and fruitful soul winner, bringing others to Christ. Mathew 28:19,20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:46-49; John 17:18; Acts 1:8; 8:1-4; Psalms 126:5,6; Proverbs 11:30; Daniel 12:3; Ezekiel 3:17-21.
          
          16. That Marriage is binding for life. Monogamy is the uniform teaching of the Bible. Polygamy is contrary to God’s perfect will and institution. The Bible forbids a believer marrying an unbeliever. Also, under the New Testament dispensation, no one has a right to divorce and remarry while the first companion lives. When a person becomes converted, necessary restitution, on this line must be done without delay if he has married wrongly. Genesis 2:24; Deuteronomy 7:1-4; Joshua 23:11-13; 2 Corinthians 6:14-18; Proverbs 31:10-31; Malachi 2:14-15; Romans 7:2,3; Ephesians 5:31-33; Mathew 5:31,32; 19:3-9; Mark 10:2-12; Luke 16:18; John 4:15-19; Genesis 20:3,7.
          
          17. That the Rapture (the first phase or stage of the SECOND COMING OF CHRIST) is the catching away from the earth of all living saints; and all who died in the Lord. The Rapture will take place before the Great Tribulation and can happen any time from now.
          “In a twinkling of an eye” without a moment’s warning, “the trumpet shall sound”, “and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” John 14:1-3; Luke 21:34-36; 1 Corinthians 15:51-58; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 5:4-9; 2 Thessalonians 2:5-7; Philippians 3:11,20,21; 1 John 3:1-3.
          
          18. That the Resurrection of the dead is taught in the Bible as clearly as the immortality of the soul. Every individual who has ever lived will be resurrected, some to honor and glory and others to everlasting shame and contempt. Job 19:25-27; Psalm 71:20; Isaiah 26:19; Daniel 12:2; John 5:28,29; 1 Corinthians 15:12-57; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-16; Hebrews 6:1,2; Philippians 3:8-11; Revelation 20:4,6,12,13.
          
          19. That the Great Tribulation will occur after the Rapture and will be a time of terrible suffering on earth. It is also referred to as the time of Jacob’s trouble. Mathew 24:21,22,29; Revelation 9:16; Mark 13:19; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12; Revelation 13. During this time, the Antichrist will take possession of this world for a reign of terror. He will not be a system or organization but a person – a supernatural diabolical being, in the form of a man who will blaspheme and proclaim himself to be God (Daniel 8:23,25; 2 Thessalonians 2:7-12; Revelation 13:1-10). The Marriage Supper of the Lamb will take place above while the tribulation continues on earth Revelation 19:1-10.
          
          20. The Second Coming of Christ will be just as literal and visible as His going away, and He is coming to execute judgment upon the ungodly. He will also, then, set up His Kingdom and reign on this present earth for a thousand years. Zechariah 14:3,4; Mathew 25:31-46; Mark 13:24-37; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10; 2:8; Jude 14,15.
          
          21. That Christ’s Millennial Reign is the 1,000 years’ literal reign of Jesus on earth, which will be ushered in by the coming of Jesus back to earth with ten thousands of His saints. At this time He will judge the nations that dwell upon the face of the earth. Jude 14,15; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10. During this time the devil will be bound. Revelation 20:2,3. It will be a reign of peace and blessing. Isaiah 11:6-9; 65:25; Hosea 2:18; Zechariah 14:9-20; Isaiah 2:2-4.
          
          22. That the Great White Throne Judgment is when God finally judges all (the living and the dead, small and great) who have ever lived on the face of the earth, according to their works. This is after the Millennium. At this time, the final Judgment known as the Great White Throne Judgment, will be held. All those from all ages, who have not yet been judged (believers’ judgment, as sinners was accomplished by Christ on the Cross – John 5:24; 3:17-19) will stand before God at this time. The devil and his angels are judged at this time also and sent to the lake of fire forever. Dan 12:2,3; Matt 10:15; 11:21-24; 12:41,42; John 5:28,29; Rom 2:15,16; 14:12; 2 Pet 2:9; Jude 6; 1 Cor 6:1-4; Acts 10:42; Rev 20:11-15.
          
          23. That the New Heaven and the New Earth “wherein dwelleth righteousness” will be made by God and the redeemed shall dwell with God forever. This present earth, which has been polluted by sin, will pass away after the Great White Throne Judgment (Psalm 102:25,26; Isaiah 51:6; 65:17; Mathew 5:18; 24:35; 2 Peter 3:10-13; Revelation 21:1). No unclean thing will be there. We shall know each other, our knowledge having been perfected. There will be no more curses upon anything. There will be no more night, the glory of the Lord will be the light thereof. Isaiah 66:22; 2 Peter 3:12,13; 1 Cor 13:12; 1 John 3:2,3; Rev 21:1-7; 22:1-5.
          
          24. That Hell-fire is a place of everlasting punishment where sinners (all who do not have their names in the book of life) will suffer torments forever and ever. It was prepared for the devil and his angels (Mathew 25:41) but God has decreed that the wicked and those who forgets Him and reject Christ will also be cast there because of their sin and neglect of His salvation. Ps 9:17; Mt 25:46; Lk 12:4,5; 16:19-31; Mt 5:22,30; Mk 9:43-47; Rev 14:10,11; 20:12-15.

          You know assuredly that GOD has made this JESUS, whom you crucified, both LORD and CHRIST. A MAN attested by GOD to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which GOD did through HIM in your midst as you know. Acts 2:22 & 36.
          
          This is the STONE rejected by men that is now a CHIEF CORNER STONE. This is the LORD’S doing in/through ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS and it is marvellous in our eyes. 1st Peter 2:6-8; Mark 12:10-11 & Isaiah 28:16.
          
          Whoever believes in JESUS shall not be condemned; but whoever does not believe in JESUS is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten SON of GOD. John 3:16-22.
          
          And truly CHRIST JESUS is doing many live miracles in the life and presence of people through ZION MOUNTAIN MINISTRY FOR ALL NATIONS which are not recorded; but these are written that you may believe that JESUS our LORD is the CHRIST the SON of the MOST HIGH GOD, and HE is ALIVE and ACTIVE forever. And that believing and accepting HIM into your life as SAVIOUR and LORD you may have life in HIS name. John 20:30-31.
          
          Please, feel free to fellowship with us, for we shall be glad to see you in our midst.
          
          CHRIST JESUS our all, ZION CITY our goal.</p>
